Larn was written by Noah Morgan in the mid 1980s with the last release
posted to USENET in 1986.

Ularn was written in 1987 by Phil Cordier at UC Santa Cruz based on
the Larn source code.  It is currently maintained by Josh Brandt who
took it over in 2001.

iLarn by Bridgit Spitznagel (aka i0lanthe) was derived from Ularn in
the early 2000s as a version of Ularn for PalmOS devices.

ReLarn was written by Chris Reuter between 2010 and 2019.  It was
derived from Ularn version "1.15ish" dated "16 November 2001" with
some elements taken from iLarn.

Line-of-sight code was written by Greg McIntyre via "libfov", most of
which is included here.

These are all of the contributors that I know of; there are likely
many others.
