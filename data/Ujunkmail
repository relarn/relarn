News of your great conquest has spread to all of Larndom.  Might I
have a moment of a great ${woman}'s time?  We here at St.  Mary's
Children's Home are very poor and many children are starving.  Disease
is widespread and very often fatal without good food.  Could you
possibly find it in your heart to help us in our plight?  Whatever you
could give would help much.  (your gift is tax-deductible)

Dear Mr Sir Highness ${player_email},

Allow me to introduce myself.  I am an attorney representing the sole
heir of the recently deceased God of Hellfire.

As you know, Mr O'Hellfire had amassed considerable wealth prior to
his tragic death.  However, due to certain unfounded allegations of
illegality these assets are now frozen.  This is especially
unfortunate for my client who is currently destitute and needs to sell
timeshares in order to survive.

Fortunately, I have come upon an unfrozen account in the name of
Mr. O'Hellfire currently holding slightly more than ten million
(10,000,000) gold pieces. I require a discreet intermediary who is
willing to receive this money and then forward it to my client.  In
return, this intermediary will earn fifteen percent (15%) of the
account's value as a commission.

Please contact me if you are interested in participating in this
venture.
