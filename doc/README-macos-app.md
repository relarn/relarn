# macOS Caveats

This package is experimental and may not work on your system.  If it
doesn't, try the `.tar.gz` distribution instead.

There is also a good chance that your version of macOS will give you
the OH NOES A H4XX0R error; this may or may not be overrideable.

If it does work, note that your high score file will not be shared
between users on the same computer.  This is because it is stored
inside the .app bundle itself, which is severely frowned-upon.
